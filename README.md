# Super Store Sales Dashboard

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes **sales performance for a retail superstore** across regions, product categories, and individual products.  
The objective is to deliver an **executive-ready Power BI dashboard** that enables stakeholders to quickly understand business performance, profitability, and sales trends for informed decision-making.

## Business Problem
Retail organizations need clear visibility into:
- Which products and regions generate the most revenue
- Where profits are increasing or declining
- How sales performance changes over time  

Without a centralized reporting solution, identifying opportunities and risks becomes challenging.

## 🧾 Executive Summary
The Super Store achieved **$2.30M in total sales** and **$286.4K in total profit**, resulting in a **12.47% profit margin**.

The **West region** is the top-performing region by sales (**$0.73M**), while the **Central region** recorded the **lowest profitability (7.9%)**, indicating margin pressure.

The **Consumer segment** generates the highest share of sales, followed by Corporate and Home Office. Although sales show steady growth over time, an average discount of **15.62%** contributed to a **loss of $156.13K**, highlighting the need for better discount control and margin optimization.
